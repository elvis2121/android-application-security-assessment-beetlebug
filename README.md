# Android Application Security Assessment: Beetlebug

## Objective
Performed a controlled Android application assessment using static analysis, ADB-driven dynamic testing, storage inspection, and backend validation to identify eight security weaknesses.

### Skills Learned
- Mapped application resources, exported activities, embedded values, and backend URLs.
- Pulled SQLite and Shared Preferences artifacts and verified plaintext sensitive data.
- Monitored Logcat for credit-card and PII leakage.
- Validated SQL injection, public Firebase access, and unauthenticated administrator activity invocation.
- Assigned risk ratings and paired every finding with actionable remediation.

### Tools Used
- JADX
- ADB
- Logcat
- SQLite Browser
- curl
- jq
- Android emulator

## Steps

*Ref 1: Static analysis in JADX shows the folder-unlock PIN being compared against a resource string instead of a value generated or protected at runtime.*

*Ref 2: The referenced value in `strings.xml` exposes the hardcoded unlock PIN, allowing the secret to be recovered directly from the decompiled APK.*

*Ref 3: Entering the recovered PIN unlocks the protected folder and confirms that an embedded client-side secret can be used to complete the challenge.*

*Ref 4: The promo-code activity contains a hardcoded discount value, making the code recoverable through reverse engineering.*

*Ref 5: Submitting the recovered promo code applies the discount in the application, demonstrating that the promotion logic is enforced on the client and can be abused repeatedly.*

*Ref 6: Pulling `shared_pref_flag.xml` with ADB reveals that the application stores the submitted username, password, and flag value in plaintext Shared Preferences.*

*Ref 7: The Shared Preferences challenge screen shows the same credentials entered in the app, linking the plaintext XML artifact back to user-controlled input.*

*Ref 8: ADB is used to pull `user.db` from the application data directory, showing that the local SQLite database is accessible for offline inspection on a test device.*

*Ref 9: After pulling `user.db`, DB Browser for SQLite shows the master PIN stored as readable text in the `users` table.*

*Ref 10: A basic SQL injection payload bypasses the intended lookup and returns multiple users, including usernames, passwords, and credit-card values.*

*Ref 11: Reviewing `strings.xml` also exposes the Firebase Realtime Database URL, which provides a direct backend target for access-control testing.*

*Ref 12: Querying the Firebase `.json` endpoint with `curl` and formatting it with `jq` returns database records without authentication, confirming public read access.*

*Ref 13: The unauthenticated Firebase response includes the challenge flag and other user-submitted fields, showing the impact of the misconfigured database rules.*

*Ref 15: The card number, expiry date, and CVV entered into the payment form are sensitive values that should not be persisted or emitted in application logs.*

*Ref 17: The Android manifest exposes `app.beetlebug.ctf.b33tleAdministrator`, allowing the admin activity to be launched from outside the normal app flow.*
